I am a researcher working at the intersection of structural and construction engineering, motivated by the resilience and sustainability of communities. I develop mechanics-based methods to predict the behavior of partially composite concrete structures, investigate the behavior of structural components under static and cyclical load, and perform structural reliability analyses. These aspects help engineers and stakeholders make informed decisions about the implementation of sustainable and economical materials and components to promote a more sustainable world.

I have experience using structural analysis methods and techniques, computer algorithms and finite element software, and displacement, load, strain, and temperature sensors to introduce sustainable and durable alternatives for bridge and building components, develop calculation methods that engineers can use to complete routine design tasks and increase community resilience through the use of calibrated safety factors.

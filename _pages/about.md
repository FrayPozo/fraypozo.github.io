I am a Research Assistant Professor working in the [Innovative Bridge Technologies/Accelerated Bridge Construction University Transportation Center (IBT-ABC UTC)](https://abc-utc.fiu.edu) of the [Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering](https://cee.fiu.edu) at [Florida International University](https://fiu.edu).

My work intersects many aspects of structural and construction engineering, such as material characterization, empirical formwork performance, large-scale structural testing, and structural reliability. I have previously developed mechanics-based methods to predict the behavior of partially composite concrete structures, investigated the behavior of structural components under static and cyclical load, and performed structural reliability analyses. These aspects help engineers and stakeholders make informed decisions about the implementation of sustainable and economical materials and components to promote a more sustainable world.

My research interests involve precast/prestressed concrete, FRP-reinforced concrete, structural mechanics, reliability analysis and code development, sustainable construction, and digital fabrication with concrete.
